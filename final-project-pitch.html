	<strong><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-size:22px;">Manchester United&rsquo;s crossing-maniac: David Moyes&rsquo; fault?</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">***</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">Since the Scottish coach David Moyes took charge of the English Premier League football team Manchester United from the retired legend Sir Alex Ferguson by the end of the 2012/13 season, the 13-time Premier League title winner has been widely criticized by media and supporters for its outdated and unskillful crossing tactics on the pitch. In a home match against Fulham on February 9th, 2014, among a total of 85 crosses created by both teams in 90 minutes, Manchester United contributed <a href="http://nbcprosoccertalk.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/man-united-crosses-v-fulham.png">an insane 81 crosses</a>, none of which led to a goal. Fulham boss Rene Meulensteen described United&#39;s style as &quot;straightforward&quot;. With a disappointing record of 13-6-8 in the 2013/14 season, Manchester United has now dropped to the seventh on the Premier League table.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">Yet, in United&rsquo;s 28 previous seasons led by Sir Alex Ferguson, the team was widely known for its massive use of wingers, which also involves long-ball crosses from both of the attacking sides on the pitch. I would like to visualize the actual change of Manchester United&rsquo;s crossing tactics from the 2012/13 season to the current (2013/14) season and find out if David Moyes has indeed adopted more of the crossing tactics in open play than his predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">I will need to acquire the match-by-match open play crossing stats of Manchester United in the 2012/13 and 2013/14 English Premier League seasons, in the following forms:</span></span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">Which player produced the cross;</span></span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">Exact position where the cross was made. On October 15th, 2012, The Guardian published a similar <a href="http://gu.com/p/3b5k3">interactive analysis of Manchester City&#39;s match data</a> on one single Premier League match against Bolton Wanderers, using the <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/">Tableau</a> software;</span></span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">Whether the cross was successful (either led to an attempt shot or a goal) or not;</span></span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">Total number of open play crosses per match;</span></span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">Overall crossing accuracy per match.</span></span></li>
</ul>

	<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">Sources:</span></span></div>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">My go-to source would be <a href="http://www.optasports.com/">Opta Sports</a>, world&rsquo;s leading football data company. Despite the fact that its data services are only open to media partners, Opta Sports does have a new <a href="http://www.optasports.com/playground-section.aspx">&ldquo;playground&rdquo; site</a> that allows users to make data requests for academic, developing and blogging purposes. I have already submitted a data request through the website and corresponding with them lately. Will keep Kevin and Amanda informed of any updates.</span></span></li>
		<li>
			<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">There are still some sports news organizations that have purchased Opta Sports&rsquo; relevant crossing stats and made them public: see <a href="http://eplindex.com/tag/crossing-stats">here</a>, <a href="http://www.whoscored.com/Regions/252/Tournaments/2/Seasons/3853/Stages/7794/TeamStatistics/England-Premier-League-2013-2014">here</a> and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2303835/Premier-League-crossers--best-worst-season.html">here</a>.</span></span></li>
		<li>
			<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">Some other football match stats websites offer general in-match stats, but the detailed open play crossing stats cannot be found. They are listed here as back-up sources: <a href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/useful-statistics-and-tactics-resources.331840/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/useful-statistics-and-tactics-resources.331840/</a></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">I will probably need to learn news skills of D3, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. I have already had the requiring skills of the Tableau software.</span></span></p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">I will pitch this project to news sites and online football forums, mostly those in England.</span></span></p>
